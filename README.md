# X-GUARD

**X-GUARD** is a lightweight API scanner built with **FastAPI**. It allows users to scan API endpoints for basic vulnerabilities such as **XSS** and **SQL Injection**. The application features a clean web interface and supports optional token-based authentication.

## Features

* Scan API endpoints for potential **XSS** vulnerabilities.
* Scan API endpoints for potential **SQL Injection** vulnerabilities.
* Supports **token-based authentication** headers.
* Simple and clean web interface using **Jinja2 templates**.
* Fully asynchronous requests using **httpx** for fast scanning.
* No Swagger/Redoc exposed â€” user-friendly interface only.
